# ✊✋✌️ Rock Paper Scissors

A simple command-line Rock–Paper–Scissors game where a user plays against the computer. The game handles user input, randomly selects the computer’s move, and determines the winner based on standard game rules.

This project focuses on basic programming concepts such as condition checks, loops, and user interaction.
